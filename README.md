# HideSnowballs
> Hide snowballs with packets. One of my oddest plugin requests.

## Installation
Grab a copy off of the [releases page](https://github.com/Rayzr522/HideSnowballs/releases), as well as the latest [ProtoclLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/).

## Usage
Just drop it into your plugins folder with ProtocolLib and you're good to go. That's it.
